# Uber-MDP-Analytics
In this project, we aim to give an answer to the problem facing Uber/Lyft/Taxi Driver: "If I'm in Washington Heights at 2pm on a Monday, should I stay in Washington Heights or drive to another neighborhood to look for more riders?"
We use NYC taxi data to create an MDP representation of this problem, and then we use value iteration to solve it.
If you're a driver, just run interface.py and input your neighbohood and time, and it'll tell you what to do.
